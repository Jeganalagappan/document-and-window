As a JavaScript developer, you've likely encountered the document and window objects numerous times.
While they may seem similar, these two objects serve distinct purposes and have different properties 
and methods. In this comprehensive guide, we'll delve into the differences between document and window objects,
exploring their roles, properties, and use cases.

Document:
   The document object represents the HTML document that is currently loaded in the browser. 
It is a part of the Document Object Model (DOM), which is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. 
The document object provides access to the document's structure, content, and properties.

Window:
   The window object represents the browser window that contains the document.
It is the top-most object in the Browser Object Model (BOM) and provides access to the browser' 
properties and methods. The window object is often referred to as the global object,
as it is the root object of the JavaScript environment.

Key differences between document and window objects

Scope: The document object is specific to the current HTML document, whereas the window 
object is related to the browser window that contains the document.

Properties and Methods: The document object has properties and methods that are primarily
focused on the document's structure and content, such as document.title, document.body, 
and document.getElementById(). In contrast, the window object has properties and methods 
that are related to the browser window, such as window.location, window.history, and window.open().

Event Handling: The document object is often used as an event target for events that occur within the document,
such as clicks, key presses, and mouse movements. The window object, on the other hand, is used as an event 
target for events that occur at the window level, such as window resizing, scrolling, and closing.

Accessibility: The document object provides access to the document's content and structure,
making it an essential tool for accessibility features like screen readers. The window object,
while not directly related to accessibility, provides access to the browser's properties and methods 
that can be used to enhance accessibility.

Document Object Use Cases :

Dynamic Content Generation: The document object is often used to dynamically generate content, 
such as creating new elements, setting innerHTML, and manipulating the document's structure.

Event Handling: The document object is used as an event target for events that occur within the document,
such as clicks, key presses, and mouse movements.

Accessibility: The document object provides access to the document's content and structure, 
making it an essential tool for accessibility features like screen readers.

Window Object Use Cases

Navigation and Routing: The window object is used to navigate between pages, manipulate the browser's history,
and control the window's location.

Window Management: The window object provides access to the browser window's properties and methods, 
such as resizing, scrolling, and closing.

Global Variables and Functions: The window object is often used as a global namespace for variables 
and functions that need to be accessed across the application.
